      I am a research scientist at Google. Before Google, I was a researcher at Microsoft Research Montreal.
      I got my MSc and PhD under the excellent supervision of Prof. Keun Ho Ryu from the Department of Computer Science at Chungbuk National University, South Korea.
      I studied my bachelor in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia at the National University of Mongolia where my thesis topic was on demand forecasting with regression analysis.

      My current research focus is on meta-learning, memory and attention systems, rapid and temporal adaptations and learning feedbacks in artificial neural networks.

      As a graduate student, I had a chance to work for a couple of startups where we focused on personalized document processing pipeline and search engine at scale. From 2012-2015, I actively participated in Kaggle competitions and I peaked at world rank 422 (top <1.0%).

      A few sport activities I attempt to do are weight training, volleyball and swimming. I also like to have beer while playing pool and discussing ideas and technology.
