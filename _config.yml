      Currently I am a postdoctoral associate at Prof. Hongâ€™s BioNLP group at UMass. I recently graduated from the Department of Computer Science at Chungbuk National University, South Korea under the excellent supervision of Prof. Keun Ho Ryu.

      My research focuses on semi-supervised learning, representation learning and deep learning for natural language understanding and clinical/biomedical information extraction.

      I have several years of experience in programming with java (EE), including swing, JSF, EJB, and JPA. In addition, I have recently been playing with Scala, Python, R and Lua. I got the opportunity to try deep learning frameworks like Torch, Chainer, MXNET and Keras, data processing tools like Mahout, Scikit-learn, Weka and Opencv (Javacv), NoSQL database systems including Hbase, Redis, MongoDB and Cassandra, indexing technologies such as Apache Solr and Lucene, distributed computing and storage tools like Hadoop, Spark and Scalding (for Hadoop) and some other systems for document processing pipelines.

      I would like to do a few sport activities frequently: bodybuilding, soccer, volleyball and swimming. I also like to have a beer while playing pool and discussing ideas and technology.
