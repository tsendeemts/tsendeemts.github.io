  <title>Tsendsuren Munkhdalai &#8226;  I am a researcher at Microsoft Research Montreal. I spent two years at the University of Massachusetts as a postdoc sitting right next to the neurology department. I got my MSc and PhD under the excellent supervision of Prof. Keun Ho Ryu from the Department of Computer Science at Chungbuk National University, South Korea. I studied my bachelor in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia at the National University of Mongolia where my thesis topic was on demand forcasting with regression analysis.   My current research focus is on meta-learning, memory and attention systems, rapid and temporal adaptations and learning feedbacks in artificial neural networks.   As a graduate student, I had a chance to work for a couple of startups where we focused on personalized document processing pipeline and search engine at scale. I also used to participate in Kaggle competitions and held the competitions expert badge from the Kaggle community.   A few sport activities I attemp to do are weight training, volleyball and swimming. I also like to have beer while playing pool and discussing ideas and technology. </title>
